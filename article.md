# A Think First AI

Now, I know what you're probably thinking. "Think first AI? That isn't new." And you're right. Thinking models have been around for a long time, but I wanted to try something a little different.

What I got to thinking about is what happens if you make outputting to the user a deliberate action of the LLM (tool call). The LLM will be invoked in a loop, with it being feed back it's internal dialog each time.
